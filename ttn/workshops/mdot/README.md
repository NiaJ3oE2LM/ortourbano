# The Things Network Workshop: MultiTech mDot and ARM mbed

## Introduction

This workshop walks you through the process of building a LoRa enabled internet-of-things application, from device to end-user application.

The device will be powered by the MultiTech mDot using the ARM mbed development environment. We will be using Node RED and IFTTT to program your cloud application.

## Hardware requirements

- LoRaWAN gateway connected to The Things Network
- MultiTech mDot with UDK2
- Micro USB cable

## Setting up The Things Network



### MultiTech mDot custom application

1. Plug the mDot on the UDK2
2. Login to the ARM mbed compiler
3. Import the [Hello world sample](https://developer.mbed.org/teams/The-Things-Network/code/mDot_Workshop/)
4. Compile and copy the file to your mDot
